## evcc Style

### Naming

**evcc is always written in lowercase**, as you see in our logo. Please don't(!) do EVCC.

### Artwork

evcc logos, icons and vector files can be found in [/artwork](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc.io/tree/main/artwork). Screenshots of the UI are located in [/static/img/screenshots](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc.io/tree/main/static/img/screenshots). Feel free to use them if you create content about evcc or build software/integrations in the evcc ecosystem.

### Colors

- logo green: #0FDD42
- logo black: #18191A

The UI uses variations of these colors. The source of truth is the [app.css](https://github.com/evcc-io/evcc/blob/master/assets/css/app.css#L25-L30).
